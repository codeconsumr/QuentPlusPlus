🔹 Quent++ - Hybrid C++ & Python NLP Engine

Quent++ is a high-performance Natural Language Processing engine built using a hybrid C++ core for speed and Python bindings for accessibility.
Designed as part of an academic dissertation, the project explores how low-level optimisation, custom data structures, and efficient memory management can outperform traditional Python-based NLP libraries — while still offering a modern Pythonic API.

The repository contains:

⚡ C++ implementations of NLP components (tokeniser, vectoriser, preprocessing, etc.)

🔗 pybind11 bindings allowing seamless Python↔C++ integration

🧪 Benchmarking tools comparing native C++ vs. Python performance

📦 A Python package interface (quentpp) for easy integration into ML pipelines

🧭 Documentation & design notes supporting dissertation submission

🧹 Clean modular structure making it easy to test, extend, and maintain

Quent++ aims to demonstrate how combining Python’s usability with C++'s raw performance can produce a flexible yet efficient NLP system suitable for research, experimentation, and further development.
